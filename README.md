Project Name: SHIELD

**SHIELD** (Safety Hazard Identification and Emergency Law Deployment) is an app that uses machine learning to predict the priority of a road accident based upon 28 caracteristics received by a police administrator during a call. Its purpose is to help prioritize interventions to gain in efficiency.

## Project Team:
SHIELD was first developped in its early stages by the team:

- Fabrice **Charraud** ([@FCharraud](https://github.com/FCharraud))
- Omar **Choa** ([@omarchoa](https://github.com/omarchoa))
- Michael **Deroche** ([@miklderoche](https://github.com/miklderoche))
- Alexandre **Winger** ([@alexandrewinger](https://github.com/alexandrewinger))

Now, it is only developped by **Alexandre WINGER**.

## Setup

### 1- First, you'll have to clone the repo:

    `git clone https://github.com/alexandrewinger/shield.git`

### 2- Let's change our current repository:
    `cd shield`

### 3- Launch the app:
    `docker-compose up`

### 4- The streamlit app should be ready for you to test in your favorite browser:
    `http://127.0.0.1:8501`
